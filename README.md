Lab 4: Geological cross-section
Due   date: Oct.   14th, 2024,   11:00 pm   for   Monday   Lab   session    Oct.   17th, 2024   11:00 pm   for   Thursday   Lab   session
Total: 50   points
For this lab you will need 
Graph paper
Mechanical Pencil or regular pencil with a sharpened point for neatness
Color pencils
Ruler
Protractor
Eraser
The artificial geological map on the last   page shows   several   sedimentary   layers. Using   structure   contours (strike lines) construct a geological profile along the   line Y-Z.   Do   not   exaggerate   the profile (No vertical exaggeration). Determine thickness and orientation (dip   direction   and   dip)   of   the individual layers. It is recommended that you draw your cross-section   on   Graph paper. 
Marking scheme
a.         Strike lines on map-   5 point
b.       Topography on the cross-section (solid line for known,   dashed   for unknown)-   5 points
c.       Lithologies on the   cross-section-   5 points
d.       代 写ESS241 Lab 4: Geological cross-sectionR
代做程序编程语言Orientation of   the lithologies (show your calculations)- 5 points
e.       Does the cross-section show the true dip   or   apparent   dip   of   the   lithologies?   How   do   you   know this? -      3 points
f.         True thickness of   the lithologies B, C, D, E (show your   calculations)-   5 points
g.       Title and north   arrow-   1 point   h.         Scale -   2 points
i.          Label Axes- 2 point
j.         Label outlier and inlier (on map and cross-section)-   4 points
k.       Imagine there is a deposition of   new sediments   in the   eastern valley   of   your   cross-section. What   type   of   unconformity   would   you   have   here? - 2 points
l.         At what angle, to your original cross-section would you have to draw a   second   cross-   section to see the dips of   the lithologies at   10o   ?   (Show your   calculations)-   6 points
m.   Neatness (Legible handwriting, crisp lines, clean cross-section)- 5 points Length
